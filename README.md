Welcome to habit hacker ,where your daily habit tracking needs might be met !

This is for my test in Front End Development at HIREXE

This main initial project setup was +- 1 hour , to set everything up and getting going from firebase ,so on and so forth

Initial coding for this project took me around +- 3 Hours 

And then debugging ,integrating a login system from firebase took me another +- 1 hour and a half

This is just a basic program to show where I am at !


This app allows you to create and log in with a user , when loging in you are left with a screen that allows you to create new habits for a day , marking them as Done, then displays on the calendar as a darker shade of green indicating a task has been done on a specific day , you can also se your total habits for the day , completed today , current habit streak , and a date picker allowing you to see habits on a specfic month and date , there is also a journaling section allowing you to type in how you feel on a specific day and lock that in.
